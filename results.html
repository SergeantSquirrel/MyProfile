<p>These results more so confirm what I already knew. I do prefer to be introverted and observant rather than a socialite.
   I also gain my energy from solitude and can quite easily become socially exhausted in group environments. However,
   I do have the capability to ‘come out of my shell’ when required. A skill I was able to learn through leadership roles in scouts,
   cadets and being house captain in my school which has followed me into the workforce in bar jobs and during my time of being a crew leader
    on major construction projects. Therefore, these tests are quite accurate to who I am as a person, however they certainly do not define who I am;
    I am confident, communicative and when required can be a good leader.</p>
