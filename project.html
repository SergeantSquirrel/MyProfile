<h1><u>Project Idea</u></h1>
<p>There is a fair amount of reading in this one, so bare with me and thank you for your patience!</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p>The project will be a complete overhaul of an existing app. I would have liked to develop one myself however it already exists
  in a very basic form. I would like to overhaul it or even start a whole new one called fun-kommunity. The main idea behind it will be to
  connect people, suppliers, and show Funko collections. It will have a unique marketplace feature, links to websites where people can purchase
  Funko pops they need, and a personalized ‘my collection’ feature. There will also be a forum tab for general discussions.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

  <p>Each year Funko pops become more and more popular. It is a slowly growing industry, and you will be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t own
    one. They are becoming a well sought out collector’s item and their cute design makes it appealing to many target audiences. According to their
    2019 annual report, in the last 5 years Funko have had a 1305.678% increase in NET sales. As we have seen recently, collector’s items like Pokémon
     cards have spiked in value seeing rare cards going for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Funko pops are nowhere near this level of value however,
      it is apparent that early generations and condition of these pops are showing drastic increases in value.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The current app that exists is called ‘Funko’. This app is quite limited in its capabilities and not very well known at all.
  It allows users to search for Pops that they own and add them to their ‘collection’, or they may have their own ‘wish list’.
  It is a great way to keep track of the pops the user owns as many people have hundreds.</p>
<p>The first feature I would like to add to this is, a barcode scanner. Funko pops, like many other collectibles, have seasonal, limited edition,
  special edition, and store exclusive pops. This can prove frustrating when trying to manually search for the pop in the app. The barcode scanner
  will eliminate this process by pulling up the exact model of Funko. This will then allow the user to add it to their ‘collection’. The manual search
   engine will still be available as the user may want to add a pop to their ‘wish list’. </p>
<p>As the name suggests (Fun-kommunity) this will have many other features to help connect people. The first major feature will be a marketplace on
   the app itself. This will be an extremely simple version. A user will not need to make an ad from scratch to be posted as that can be time
    consuming and will eliminate any input error from the user. The user may be able to list their pops into the marketplace directly from their
    ‘collection’ tab. Selecting one or multiple pops in the tab will provide an option to ‘add to marketplace’. When selecting this option, most of
    the ad will be prefilled out with the description of the product and the user can select from a drop-down menu of ‘sell’ or ‘trade’. There will
    be a prefilled-out price showing the current market value of the pop/s, however the user will be able to manually change this price. If the price
    is manually changed, the ad will display the market value below it. </p>
<p>Under the ‘wish list’ tab, there will be a similar feature. However, it will display an ‘EOI’ (expression of interest) ad. This is where
  people may branch out and request specific pops they are hunting. This is not only a helpful feature for collectors but also small businesses and
  suppliers. There is a plethora of collectible stores around in the community that many people may not even know about, nor would they know what
  stock they have in detail unless they are physically in the store. This EOI feature will allow small businesses to branch out to customers and
  potentially boost sales. </p>
<p>There will be a small chat feature to allow users to communicate through the marketplace. This eliminates needing to publicly provide phone
   numbers, unnecessary personal information and any need to communicate through social media. However, transactions will need to be done outside
   of the app. User’s entire collections can be toggled between private/public depending on their preference.</p>
<p>The final kommunity feature will be a public forum on the app. This is a useful tool that can be used for many purposes. As collections grow,
  generally people like to display them, the forum can be used as inspiration on how to do that as other users can post images of their collections
  showing different techniques on how to display them. It can be used for general discussion and debates or highlighting stores in the area that
  people may be interested in going to check out. </p>

  <p><strong>Tools and Skills</strong><p>
    <p>This is quite a complex app to develop as there are many features to be added. It is a feasible endeavor however the tool and skills
      required are currently beyond my own. There are several changeset-based deployments that could be used however, I would rather start the app
      from scratch. Ideally this app would be designed for both iOS and Android to allow as many users as possible into the kommunity. A key feature
      of the app will be simplicity; therefore, a wireframe would be the first step to develop a basic layout of the app. Although this app will
      undergo rigorous penetration testing, its simplicity is also its safety net. Since there is minimal personal information need and transactions
      are done outside of the app, any data breaches will cause minimal impact to the user.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>This is a basic idea and there are many avenues to pursue that would benefit this app’s development. My hope if this were a successful app
  would be to connect people who have a very common interest. This is a very niche market that is heavily underestimated. Funko’s entangle everything
   from reality shows to vintage cartoons; they come in different sizes, colors and editions that appeal to all target audiences with their cute
   design. In my experience of collecting them myself and talking to others, people love to show off their collections and often talk about stores
    or locations where they found cool and unique pops. This app will allow all that to happen in a single digital and safe space. I would hope it
    would encourage and motivate more people to grow their collections once they see how big the market is. Showing off their own collections and
    simplifying the process of collecting is a great attraction.</p>
