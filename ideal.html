  <p style="font-size: 18px;"> This is a job advertisement for a Cyber Security Operations Specialist with Boeing Defence Australia. This specialist role is directly involved
    with their current Currawong project. The Currawong project is ‘an integrated Battlefield Telecommunications Network system’.
    It is a revolutionised communication network that allows direct video and audio transmission with Australia’s
    headquarters and troops deployed around the globe. Boeing, who is the prime contractor for the project is looking for an
    individual who can assess, analyse, and test the vulnerabilities of the network and identify solutions to mitigate the problems.
    Coming from a military family I have always been interested in the Australian Defence Force and during my time at University of Queensland,
    I was lucky enough to be a part of a field trip into Boeing’s headquarters in Brisbane. Since then, I have considered any opportunity at Boeing to
     be an ideal job being able to work on ADF projects. </p>
     <p style="font-size: 18px;">As the term specialist suggests, this is not a graduate position. The advertisement specifies several skills and knowledge required for the job.
        There are many cyber related programs and software systems that the individual needs to be well experienced in including a sound level in the
         Australian Defence security framework and relevant policies. </p>
         <p style="font-size: 18px;">Unfortunately, my current level of knowledge and qualifications is nowhere near to this calibre. Presently, most of my IT knowledge has
           been self-taught as a hobby. I plan on focussing my attention on as many cyber security related courses. After my Bachelor of IT is completed,
            I would like to obtain my master’s in cyber security to be a successful candidate for security specialist positions. A masters will not be
            enough to get a job like this, however it will be able to get me job experience required to make me a strong candidate. </p>
