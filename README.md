Hello to whoever reads this!_
There are a couple things to explain before you go searching through my amateur website._
The css file "floating.css" was taken from https://codepen.io/mohaiman/pen/MQqMyo and the equivalent HTML code for it are in "interest.html"_
The other source that needs referencing is in my "project.html" code for the gradient background which was sourced from https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/_

As I have several different pages for my site, I decided that on a couple of them I would try and experiment with other designs to spice them up a bit!_

For the most part this all went well except in the "interest" tab, the "Homepage" button does not work as I believe there were div's blocking the link, I could not fix this on my own so I apologise!_
